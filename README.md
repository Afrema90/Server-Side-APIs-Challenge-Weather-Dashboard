In this weeks challenge we where asked to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The goal of this site is to create a weather dashboard that gives the user todays current weather data and then a future five day forecast. It will also store the past search results allowing the user to select them and see that cities weather data again.
I did this project with the help of study group and my tutor. my tutor helped me get an API key then we fixed my linked and made sure the the css and JS was n the right folders and linked right.
To use the dashboard type the name of a city in the search box and select the spyglass. As you search the city will be saved to a list allowing you to select them again for viewing.
i also used the 5 Day Weather ForecastLinks to the external site. to retrieve weather data for cities. https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
